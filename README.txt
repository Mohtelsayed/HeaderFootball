Project Description:
A 2D football game where you can challenge friends to a
duel either on the same device locally or online on 2 sperate devices.
Playable characters include the majority CS professors,
my amazing CA, Temoor Tanveer and the legendary Eric Gao.

How to Run:
Run only the file called HeaderFootball.py

How to download 
Download the most updated version of python
Download the pygame library by using "pip install pygame"

Shortcut Commands:
There are no shortcut commands
however a cool "hidden feature" that exists is that
if you are losing an online game you can just drag the pygame window
and this will pause the game and pause your opponent's game state
until you release the pygame window
